# Salary Prediction Using Supervised Regression  

## **Project Portfolio: Machine Learning Regression Models**  
This project focuses on predicting salaries based on years of experience using three supervised machine learning models:  
1. **Linear Regression**  
2. **Decision Tree Regression**  
3. **Random Forest Regression**  

The dataset used contains information about employees’ years of experience and their corresponding salaries. The goal is to understand the relationship between years of experience and salary while identifying the most efficient regression model for accurate predictions. The dataset can be accessed from the following link: [Salary Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F0eScJlePaZkQJxBNCJHhU6p3pE7LHFO/view?usp=sharing)  


**Goals:**  
1. Predict salaries based on years of experience using regression models.  
2. Compare the performance of the three models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression.  
3. Evaluate models using metrics such as **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score** to identify the most efficient model.  

**Insights:**  
- **Linear Regression**: Provides a straightforward approach but struggles with capturing complex patterns in data.  
- **Decision Tree Regression**: Handles non-linear data well but can overfit smaller datasets.  
- **Random Forest Regression**: Outperformed other models with the **lowest MSE** and the **highest R² score**, making it the most efficient for salary prediction in this analysis.  

**Advice:**  
1. Consider adding more features (e.g., job role, industry type, location) to improve model accuracy.  
2. Hyperparameter tuning in Random Forest could further enhance prediction performance.  
3. Utilize larger datasets for better generalization of models.  
4. Explore advanced models like Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks for future improvements.
